           I'm Maha, a Software Engineer and current Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence, 
           with a strong academic background from the Moroccan School of Engineering Sciences. 
           Passionate about research, problem-solving, and emerging technologies, 
           I bring a thoughtful and detail-oriented approach to every project I work on.

          <p className="hero--section-description">
            Throughout my journey, I've worked on diverse challenges—ranging from software development and AI model 
            training to biometric database enhancement—always with a focus on impact, precision, and innovation. 
            I believe that technology, when designed thoughtfully, has the power to improve lives and solve real-world problems.
